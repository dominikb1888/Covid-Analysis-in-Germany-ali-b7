# COVID-19 Data Visualization in Germany (2020-2022)

## Description
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Germany. Utilizing geographic and COVID-19 data sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO), the project attempts to offer an understanding of the virus' spread and its correlation with healthcare indicators. The primary objective is to analyze the relationship between total cases, population numbers, and death rates. By doing so, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of healthcare systems across different regions in Germany in managing and mitigating the impact of future pandemics.

## Features
**Interactive German Map**: Navigate through a detailed map of Germany to view COVID-19 statistics by region.
**State-Level Data Visualization**: Explore various graphs showing the impact of COVID-19 in each German state.
**City-Specific Insights**: Explore data for the 60 most populated cities in Germany, understanding the local impact of the pandemic.
